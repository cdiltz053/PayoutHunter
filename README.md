# PayoutHunter - Autonomous Pen-Test Tool

This repository contains a highly optimized, autonomous Python script designed to act as a **Penetration Testing (Pen-Test) Tool** for locating and analyzing payout links.

It is configured for **cost-free, 24/7 continuous operation** on your Windows 11 machine using a self-healing architecture.

## üöÄ Master Walkthrough: Windows 11 24/7 Deployment

This guide is the final, comprehensive plan to get your script running with maximum stealth and monitoring.

### Phase 1: GitHub Setup (Secrets & Manual File Upload)

1.  **Upload the Workflow File:** You must manually upload the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file (provided previously) to your repository.
2.  **Set up GitHub Secrets:** Add your `PUSHOVER_USER` and `PUSHOVER_TOKEN` as **Secrets** in your repository settings (`Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions`).

### Phase 2: Self-Hosted Runner Setup (24/7 Machine)

1.  **Download and Extract:** Download the latest Windows x64 self-hosted runner from your repository settings and extract it to a non-system folder like **`C:\actions-runner`**.
2.  **Configure and Install as a Service:**
    *   Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
    *   Navigate to the folder: `cd C:\actions-runner`
    *   Run the configuration, then install and start the service:
        ```cmd
        svc.install.cmd
        svc.start.cmd
        ```
    *   Your laptop is now a silent, 24/7 deployment machine.

### Phase 3: Deployment and Monitoring

1.  **Trigger Deployment:** Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository and **Run the workflow**. This will install all dependencies (including Flask, Selenium, and OpSec libraries) and start the hunter and dashboard.
2.  **Find Repository Path:** The script is running from the runner's work directory (e.g., `C:\actions-runner\_work\PayoutHunter\PayoutHunter`). **Copy this full path.**
3.  **Set Up Automatic Health Check:**
    *   Open **Windows Task Scheduler**.
    *   Create a new task named `Payout Hunter Health Check`.
    *   Set the trigger to **repeat every 5 minutes** indefinitely.
    *   Set the action to run `powershell.exe` with the argument:
        ```
        -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "YOUR_REPOSITORY_PATH\health_check.ps1"
        ```

### üìä Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

The script automatically starts a web server for monitoring.

*   **Access the Dashboard:** Open your web browser and go to: **`http://localhost:5000`**
    *   The dashboard updates every 5 seconds, showing total checks, rate, and a table with the **Link ID**, the **Verification Key**, and the **Pen-Test Status**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Customization Note

For the Brute Force attack to be most effective, you may need to customize the input field selector in `payout_hunter.py` (around line 256) if the default XPATH fails to locate the phone number input field on the verification page.
